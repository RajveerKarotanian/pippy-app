# Adding Your Custom Piplup Images

To use your custom Piplup images instead of the CSS-drawn penguin:

## Steps:

1. **Add your image files** to the `public` folder:
   - Place your PNG and GIF files in: `pippy-app/public/`
   - Name them:
     - `pippy_closed.png` (closed mouth version)
     - `pippy_open.png` (open mouth version)
     - `pippy_talking.gif` (talking/animated version)

2. **Update the image paths** in `src/components/Chat.tsx`:
   - Find the lines:
           ```javascript
      const PIPPY_IMAGES = {
        closed: '/pippy_closed.png',
        open: '/pippy_open.png', 
        talking: '/pippy_talking.gif'
      };
      ```
   - Change them to match your file names if different

3. **Restart the development server** if it's running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: PNG for static images, GIF for animated talking
- **Size**: Recommended 120x120 pixels or larger
- **Style**: Square or circular works best
- **Background**: Transparent background preferred

## Features:
- **Closed mouth**: Shows when Pippy is idle
- **Open mouth**: Shows when Pippy is listening
- **Talking GIF**: Shows when Pippy is speaking
- Images will automatically switch based on Pippy's state
- If no images are found, it will fall back to the CSS-drawn penguin

## Example:
If your files are named differently, update the paths to:
```javascript
const PIPPY_IMAGES = {
  closed: '/my-pippy-closed.png',
  open: '/my-pippy-open.png', 
  talking: '/my-pippy-talking.gif'
};
```

## âœ… **Current Status:**
Your Piplup images are now properly configured and ready to use! The app will automatically:
- Show the closed mouth image when Pippy is idle
- Show the open mouth image when Pippy is listening
- Show the talking GIF when Pippy is speaking
